# Cleaner-Scrollbar
A "Show Always" scroll bar plugin for all browsers


1.  Link jQuery
2.  Link Cleaner-Scrolling.js after jQuery
3.  Initiate Cleaner-Scrolling with `$('.container').cleaner_scrolling();


This plugin currently initiates on a container then appends a fake scroll bar and scroll bar handle to that container.  It currently does not have any editable options, so you will have to edit them yourself.  I may update later if I keep interest in this.
